            <h2> Low-Coding And Its Effect On The World </h2>
            <p>
                Well, so what is low-code to start off. Low-Code or block coding is 'software that provides a development environment used to create
                application software through graphical user interfaces and configuration instead of traditional hand-coded computer programming.'
                You will find this type of Code in Wix, Scratch, GoDaddy and etc. You probably will hear this pitch:
            </p>
            <p style="color:#C5B358	">
                "Coding is in everything from your phone to your car. It's one of the main things that's making people's life easier
                and better. So wouldn’t you want to learn to code, to tap that power? Well wait no longer, with low-coding. Low-code?
                You may ask. Well its your ticket to eliminate 1000+ lines of code, and understand years of code in weeks."
            </p>
            <p>
                So What's my Forsaken Opinion on this Amazing technology? Well excited but concerned. This technology can bring power to small
                companies and people wanting to learn coding itself. But this can lead to being the norm. Is it bad? well yes and no.
                As stated, it will eliminate 1000+ lines of code and cut the time and experience in half. Its awesome, but do you know
                what is happening in the background? Is your data or information safe? Can you trust the company providing the use of
                the low-code?
            </p>

            <h2>The Good</h2>
            <p>
                Let's start slow. You have many options in having amazing or barely usable styles of block coding. A clean, smooth run
                machine with great UI to tutorials. Or quick, and dirty, to the point style of Low-code. Having many styles of operations
                that will fit around you. To add on, most to all low-coding have already set servers to payment plans ready for the user to use.
                This allows faster upload times, money being converted/transferrd faster, more secure transfer of data, and small little
                details/data being handled from the company itself. Taking many coders concerns a way. And of cocures removing time and
                experience in half.

            <h2>The Bad</h2>
            <p>
                Now I can go on about how good low-coding is to the economy, people learning coding, and etc. But I want to pull more
                toward the concern of low-coding. Let's start off with data. Even under a big company's cyber security you data is not
                protected all the time. Hackers to mistake with the company's own workers can lead to your data being stolen, misplaced or
                even changed. When you accept the use of their low-code you are required to put trust in the company doing their job. You
                have no control. On to my other point. When using their code you can't change, add, subtract, or control variables in the
                code. You are at the mercy of the company keeping their word. They can do anything they want behind doors. If you need
                examples look at fallout 76 accidently giving hundred to thousand of peoples credit cards and personal information to the
                world. Those people lost their privacy. And all that happend what a miss place or error line of code. Are you willing to flip that coin?

            </p>

            <h2>The Ugly</h2>
            <p>
                As you've been reading the blog, you've probably said what am I getting at. Well, control. The ugly part of this low-coding is
                letting the companies deal with the dirty work. Don't get me wrong its great you don't need to worry about it. But can you stop a company from putting a
                trojan horse in the code. Meaning can you see the transfer of data/money being made safely and unbugged or modified. A company can
                just take a penny or a dollar every transaction made between you and the customer. Anything can happen under the hood when you are not looking. That leads to can you trust the code will not attack you. Opinions are said
                everyday. What happens if that company disagrees with you. Well nothing is stopping them from making the job hard or letting your low-code be easily hacked. As I have badly been
                trying to say YOU ARE AT THE MERCY OF THEM. When messing with actually code you are able to see what is going on and what can happen.
                These companines can do anything they want.

            <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                In Their Defence.
                Companies need to make money and they need customers. And there are laws that try to prevent people from being harmed, but once companies control
                what is stopping them from doing what they want. Fortnite just attacked google and apple with prices over phones. As I know, Fortnite was going backdoors and breaking
                agreement with both companies. They made a transaction of money through Fortnite only. That decreases the price but opens the gates of security being reliant on fornite protecting your data. If
                low-code becomes the norm just like robots replacing workers you are dependent on the experienced coder/worker to do his job right.

                So Side Note: Sorry that its in html or in a file filled with code and sorry you have to read this god forsaken
                opinion, but I have good reasons
